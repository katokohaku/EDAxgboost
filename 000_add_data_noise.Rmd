# Purpose

Make dataset noisy according to: https://medium.com/applied-data-science/new-r-package-the-xgboost-explainer-51dd7d1aa211

## Description

according to `help(breakDown::HR_data)`, 

A dataset from Kaggle competition Human Resources Analytics: Why are our best and most experienced employees leaving prematurely?

* `satisfaction_level` Level of satisfaction (0-1)
* `last_evaluation` Time since last performance evaluation (in Years)
* `number_project` Number of projects completed while at work
* `average_montly_hours` Average monthly hours at workplace
* `time_spend_company` Number of years spent in the company
* `Work_accident` Whether the employee had a workplace accident
* `left` Whether the employee left the workplace or not (1 or 0) Factor
* `promotion_last_5years` Whether the employee was promoted in the last five years
* `sales` Department in which they work for
* `salary` Relative level of salary (high)
